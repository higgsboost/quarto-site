### Questions from @Bertsekas2000
::: {.border} 
**Example 1.11**
A class consisting of 4 graduate and 12 undergraduate students
is randomly divided into 4 groups of 4. What is the probability that each group
includes a graduate student? We interpret randomly to mean that given the assignment of some students to certain slots, any of the remaining students is equally
likely to be assigned to any of the remaining slots. 
:::

**Solution**:

At the beginning we have 16 different slots, where each group takes up 4 slots. Let $G$ be the event that every group has one grad student. 
$$
\begin{align}
A_0 = \text{\{Grad student 1 is in different groups, but $P(A_0)=1$\}}  \nonumber \\
A_1 = \text{\{Grad student 1 and 2 are in different groups\}}  \nonumber \\
A_2 = \text{\{Grad student 1, 2 and 3 are in different groups\}} \nonumber \\
A_3 = \text{\{Grad student 1, 2, 3, 4 are in different groups\}} \nonumber
\end{align}
$$

After grad student 1 has been picked only 15 people will be left, and since the available slots left is 3 we have 12 possible locations (3*4=12). Thus:


$$
P(A_1) = P(A_0 \cap A_1)=P(A_0)P(A_1|A_0)=P(A_1|A_0)=12/15
$$

Similarily:

$$
P(A_2) =P(A_1)P(A_2|A_1)=(12/15)*(2*4/14)=12*8/15*14
$$
$$
P(A_3) = P(A_2)P(A_3|A_2)=P(A_2)*4/13=0.1406
$$

Let us see if this is really the case with a simulation

```{python}
#| code-fold: true 

import numpy as np
import random
from tqdm import tqdm
valid_array = []
num_sim = 10000000 # NOTE : remember to set high for better results

for _ in range(num_sim):
  student_id = np.arange(1, 17)

  random.shuffle(student_id)

  groups = [
    student_id[0:4],
    student_id[4:8],
    student_id[8:12],
    student_id[12:16],
    ] 

  for g in groups:
    num_grad_in_g = 0 
    for g_id in [1,2,3,4]:
      if g_id in g:
        num_grad_in_g += 1
    if num_grad_in_g > 1:
      break
    
  if num_grad_in_g >1:
    valid_array.append(0)
  else: 
    valid_array.append(1)

print(f'Probability is {np.sum(valid_array)/float(num_sim)} after {num_sim} trails.')

```

**Example 1.14.** Alice is taking a probability class and at the end of each week
she can be either up-to-date or she may have fallen behind. If she is up-to-date in
a given week, the probability that she will be up-to-date (or behind) in the next
week is 0.8 (or 0.2, respectively). If she is behind in a given week, the probability
that she will be up-to-date (or behind) in the next week is 0.6 (or 0.4, respectively).
Alice is (by default) up-to-date when she starts the class. What is the probability
that she is up-to-date after three weeks?
:::


**Solution**

Let $U_i$ be the event that Alice is up-to-date at the end of week $i$ and $\overline{U}_i$ be not up-to-date, the goal is the find $P(U_3)$. 

Starting with 
$P(U_2)=P(U_2\cap U_1)\bigcup P(U_2\cap\overline{U}_1)$ which becomes $P(U_2) = P(U_1)P(U_2|U_1)+ P(\overline{U}_1)P(U_2|\overline{U}_1)$^[Additivity axiom: for disjoint sets $P(A_1 ∪ A_2 ∪···) = P(A_1) + P(A_2) + ···$]. Since she starts the week up-to-date, then $P(U_1)=0.8, P(\overline{U}_1) = 0.2$.  

Thus, $P(U_2) = 0.8 * 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.4=0.72$. 
Similarily: 
$$
P(\overline{U}_2) = P(U_1)P(\overline{U}_2|U_1)+ P(\overline{U}_1)P(\overline{U}_2|\overline{U}_1) \\
=0.8 * 0.2 + 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.28
$$

Finally, 

$$
\begin{align}
P(U_3) &= P(U_2)P(U_3|U_2)+ P(\overline{U}_2)P(U_3|\overline{U}_2) \\
&=0.72*0.8 + 0.28 * 0.4 \\
&=0.688
\end{align}
$$

**Example 1.17.** Consider an experiment involving two successive rolls of a 4-sided
die in which all 16 possible outcomes are equally likely and have probability 1/16.

 Are the events $A = \text{\{maximum of the two rolls is 2\}}, B = \text{\{minimum of the two rolls is 2}\}$ independent?
::: 

**Solution** 

They are not independent because $P(A) = 3/16, P(B) = 5/16, P(A\cap B) = 1/16 \neq 15/(16*16)$. ^[For independence, we need $P(A\cap B) = P(A)P(B)$]

**Example 1.22.** Network connectivity. A computer network connects two
nodes A and B through intermediate nodes C, D, E, F.
For every pair of directly connected nodes, say i and j, there is a given probability
pij that the link from i to j is up. We assume that link failures are independent of each other. What is the probability that there is a path connecting A and B in
which all links are up?

![](images/Example1.22.jpg)
::: 
**Solution** 

$$
\begin{align}
P(l_1:= A\rightarrow D \rightarrow B) = 0.75 * 0.95 =0.7125\\
P(l_2:=C\rightarrow E \rightarrow B) = 0.8 * 0.9 =0.72\\
P(l_3:=C\rightarrow F \rightarrow B) = 0.95 * 0.85=0.8075 \\
\end{align} 
$$

The probability that $l_4 : C\rightarrow B$ has at least one successful path is : 

$$P(l_2 \cap l_3)\cup P(l_2 \cap \overline{l_3}) \cup P(\overline{l_2} \cap l_3) = 0.9461$$ 

$$P(l_5 : A\rightarrow l_4) = 0.9 * 0.9461  = 0.85149 $$
Finally,
$$P(l_f) = P(l_1 \cap l_5)\cup P(l_1 \cap \overline{l_5}) \cup P(\overline{l_1} \cap l_5) $$ 
$$P(l_f) = 0.7125 * 0.85149 + 0.7125 * (1- 0.85149) + (1-0.7125 ) * 0.85149=0.9573$$

**Example 2.1.** Let $Y = |X|$ and let us apply the preceding formula for the PMF
$p_Y$ to the case where

$$
p_X(x) = 
\begin{cases}
1/9, &\text{if x is an integer in the range [−4, 4]} \\
0,  &\text{else}
\end{cases}
$$


The possible values of $Y$ are $y = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$.
:::

**Solution**
$$
\begin{align}
p_Y(0)&= p_X(0) \nonumber \\
p_Y(1)&= p_X(-1)  + p_X(1) \nonumber \\
p_Y(2)&= p_X(-2)  + p_X(2) \nonumber  \\
p_Y(3)&= p_X(-3)  + p_X(3)  \nonumber \\
\end{align}
$$


Thus the PMF of $Y$ is 

$$
p_Y(y) = 
\begin{cases}
1/9, &\text{If $y=0$} \\
2/9, &\text{If $y=1,2,3,4$} \\
0, &\text{else} \\
\end{cases}
$$

The mean^[$\bold{E}[X]=\sum_x x p_X (x)$] is then

$$
\bold{E}[Y]=0 * 1/9 + 2/9 + 2*2/9 + 3*2/9 + 4*2/9=20/9
$$

The variance^[$var(X) = \bold{E}((X-\bold{E}(X))^2)$], let $Z=(Y-\bold{E}(Y))^2$
$$
p_Z(z) = 
\begin{cases}
(20/9-1/9)^2, &\text{If $y=0$} \\
(20/9-2/9)^2, &\text{If $y=1,2,3,4$} \\
0, &\text{else} \\
\end{cases}
$$

Thus

$$
var(Y) = (18/9)^2  +  2*(18/9)^2 +3*(18/9)^2 +4*(18/9)^2
$$

**Example 2.8.** Average Speed Versus Average Time. If the weather is good
(which happens with probability 0.6), Alice walks the 2 miles to class at a speed of
V = 5 miles per hour, and otherwise drives her motorcycle at a speed of V = 30
miles per hour. What is the mean of the time T to get to class?
:::

**Solution**
$$
p_T(t) = 
\begin{cases}
0.6 & \text{if $t = 2/5$} \\
0.4 & \text{if $t = 2/30$} \\
\end{cases}
$$

Thus, 

$$
E[T] = 0.6*2/5 + 0.4*2/30
$$

But using $E[V]$ to find $E[T]$ using $E[T] = E[1/V] =1/E[V]$ doesn't work. Because $1/x$ is not linear.

**Example 2.11.** Professor May B. Right often has her facts wrong, and answers
each of her students’ questions incorrectly with probability 1/4, independently of
other questions. In each lecture May is asked 0, 1, or 2 questions with equal probability 1/3. Let X and Y be the number of questions May is asked and the number of
questions she answers wrong in a given lecture, respectively. Construct the joint
PMF $p_{X,Y} (x, y)$

:::
**Solution**


The PMF $p_{X,Y} (x, y)$^[Defined as $p_{X,Y} (x, y) = P(X=x, Y=y)$] can be found by using the multiplication rule^[$p_{X,Y}(x,y) = p_X(x)p_{Y|X}(y|x)$]:

|     	|     	|      	|      	|
|-----	|-----	|------	|------	|
| y=2 	| 0   	| 0    	| 1/48 	|
| y=1 	| 0   	| 1/12 	| 6/48 	|
| y=0 	| 1/3   	| 3/12 	| 9/48 	|
|     	| x=0 	| x=1  	| x=2  	|

**Example 2.12.** Consider four independent rolls of a 6-sided die. Let $X$ be the
number of 1’s and let $Y$ be the number of 2’s obtained. What is the joint PMF of
$X$ and $Y$ ?
:::

**Solution**

The PMF of $X$ is:

$$
p_X(x) =  \dbinom{4}{x} \left( \frac{1}{6} \right) ^x \left( \frac{5}{6}\right) ^ {4-x}
$$

$Y$  is the number 2's, so conditioned on $x$  (the number of 1's), the possible choices is limited to $2,3,4,5,6$, and the number of 2's required becomes $4-x$
$$
p_{Y|X}(y|x) =  \dbinom{4-x}{y} \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) ^y \left( \frac{4}{5}\right) ^ {4-x-y}
$$

Thus:

$$
p_{X|Y}(x,y) = 
\begin{cases}
 \dbinom{4}{x} \left( \frac{1}{6} \right) ^x \left( \frac{5}{6}\right) ^ {4-x}  \dbinom{4-x}{y} \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) ^y \left( \frac{4}{5}\right) ^ {4-x-y} &\text{If $0\leq x+y\leq 4$} \\
 0 &\text{else}
\end{cases}
$$

**Example 2.15.** Mean and Variance of the Geometric Random Variable.
You write a software program over and over, and each time there is probability $p$
that it works correctly, independently from previous attempts. What is the mean
and variance of $X$, the number of tries until the program works correctly?
:::


**Solution**

$X$ is a geometric random variable with PMF:
$$
p_X(k) = (1-p)^{k-1} p  \quad k = 1,2,3,\dots
$$

$$
E[X] = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} k   (1-p)^{k-1} p
$$
